# weather-comparison
A simple application utilizing Matplotlib to compare high and low temperatures between 2 locations.

This application utilizes Matplotlib to plot high and low temperatures to compare 2 locations. This is an extension created from exercise 16-2 of the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.

Exercise 16-2 is as follows: *The temperature scales on the Sitka and Death Valley graphs reflect the different data ranges. To accurately compare the temperature range in Sitka to that of Death Valley, you need identical scales on the y-axis. Change the settings for the y-axis on one or both of the charts in Figures 16-5 and 16-6. Then make a direct comparison between temperature ranges in Sitka and Death Valley (or any two places you want to compare).*.

I further challenged myself to add an additional file to the code (Sitka) to be able to compare both cities within the same program and plot.

The files within this repository are as follows:
